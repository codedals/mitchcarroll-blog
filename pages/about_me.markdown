<hr />
My name is Mitchell Aaron Carroll. I'm a software developer specializing in Ruby and Haskell. I'm originally from Michigan, but now I spend most of my time in Thailand and Japan.

If you have questions about living abroad as a developer, or need consultation or development services, I'm here. Shoot me an email.
